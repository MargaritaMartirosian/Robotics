/* This program uses a PB with a pullup. 
Using an internal resistor only.
Read the digital input on pin 12 and prints the value on the serial monitor.
When PB is pressed the value is 0 because it is connected to the GND.
Using Serial.print("") that prints data to the serial port as human-readable ASCII text.
The main theme of this program is the use of 
the command INPUT_PULLUP that is for an internal resistor.
