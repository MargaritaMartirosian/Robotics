/* Code to make blink LEDS one by one from one way back to the other. 
They will start from left to right, from right to left back in a loop.
This program consist of four LEDS that each blink when HIGH and do not blink when LOW.
They each have their turn to blink, they are programmed by turn.
The main theme of the program is the use of digital Write with multiple Digital Outputs.
