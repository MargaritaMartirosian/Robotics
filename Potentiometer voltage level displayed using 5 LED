/*This program is meant to be able to manipulate the potentiometer voltage level
displayed on 5 LEDs. Power on a different LED when manipulating the potentiometer.
As the voltage increase one by one light up.
Using pin A0, Analog for potentiometer.
The main theme of the program is Digital to Analog.
