/* Blink 
Turn an internal LED ON for one secod and then OFF for one second.
Using the constant in arduino LED_BUILTIN wich allows to control the built-in LED easily. 
On Arduino UNO the pin 13 is a digital pin that is used for this programm.
If we connect an external LED to pin 13 , it will act the same way as the built-in LED.
The main theme in Blink is using the digitalWrite command with a Digital Output.

void setup() {
//put your setup code here, to run once:
  pinMode(LED_BUILTIN, OUTPUT); // initialize digital pin LED_BUILTIN as an output.
}


void loop() {
//put your main code here, to run repeatedly: 
  digitalWrite(LED_BUILTIN, HIGH);  // turn the LED on by making the voltage leve HIGH
  delay(1000);                      // wait for a second
  digitalWrite(LED_BUILTIN, LOW);   // turn the LED off by making the voltage LOW
  delay(1000);                      // wait for a second
