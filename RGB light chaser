/*The following program is for a RGB light chaser. 
 Four different colours are coded for this programmed (RED,BLUE, GREEN, WHITE). 
 Using three digital pins , the RGB is ON for one second and OFF for one second.
 The main theme of this program is the use of digital Write with three Digital Outputs.
